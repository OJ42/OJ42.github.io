        About
    </h2>
    <div>
        <p>I love the creativity coding allows. If I can imagine it, I can bring it to life on the computer. I consider myself a somewhat creative person but I lack any skills in most art forms.
            That is why coding appealed to me so much. I was drawn to a creative system that functions on logic. My first professional experience with coding came when I worked for a company named
            Bluehost. I was hired to help maintain and repair websites hosted on their servers. I saw and fixed all sorts of issues on both the front and backend of those websites. I had to learn
            how to recognize breaks in sites built with WordPress, HTML and CSS, Joomla, Weebly, and all sorts of other hybrids. I also needed to know how to repair MYSQL databases, install SSL certificates
            along with thousands of plugins. After Bluehost announced they would be relocating to Arizona, I went to work with a company called Viive Events.<br><br>

            At Viive Events I was responsible for building and maintaining their web presence. I started as a web developer and became the Cheif Technology Officer. While at Viive Events we decided to begin hosting our
            festivals internationally. The first time we tried to do this we had no system in place for texting numbers outside of the United States. This issue had gone unnoticed until the day before we were to put our 
            tickets on sale. The ticketing system worked on a basis of the first buyers recieve the lowest price and as tickets sold hit certain numbers they will go up in price. Clearly communicating when the tickets 
            go on sale was crucial to the success of our events. Good communication from us to our customers would often lead to events selling out in less then an hour. I needed to find a build a system that could text 
            internationally in less then 12 hours. After several phone calls with various companies that work with mass texting, I was able to find one that could accomodate what we were trying to do. A few hours of midnight 
            oil burned and I had a system up and running. I loved my time at Viive Events and learned a lot with my time there.
